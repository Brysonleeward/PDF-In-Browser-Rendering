# Project Description

## Summary

This project has the goal of rendering a PDF document on a webpage while allowing for the use of tools (such as Zooming, Highlighting, Commenting, etc...). We will implement the use of PDFium for backend rendering of PDF documents, and we will use JavaScript for the front end manipulation / rendering.
