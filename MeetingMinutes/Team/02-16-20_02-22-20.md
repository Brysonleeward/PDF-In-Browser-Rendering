## Topics Discussed

We showed Ross what we had for our third iteration, and he was quite happy. For the third iteration we had the hidden text layer and refactored our code to be more efficient. After that we explained how it worked, and then talked 
about next steps.

## Things Clarified

We discussed exactly what we needed to have completed when we handed off the project to Ross at the end. This helped us figure out our plans for iteration 4.
