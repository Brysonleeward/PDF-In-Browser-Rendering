## Topics Discussed

We showed Ross what we had for our fourth iteration, and he was quite happy. For the fourth iteration we had the async loading working properly. We also refactored the hidden text layer and page jumping. After that we explained how it worked, and then talked about next steps.

## Things Clarified

We discussed exactly what we needed to have completed when we handed off the project to Ross at the end. We discussed maintenance plan and deployment. This helped us figure out our plans for iteration 5 and what features he would like us to target for the final steps.
