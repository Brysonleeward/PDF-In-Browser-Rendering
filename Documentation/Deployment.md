# Deployment Manual

- The project will run on any server currently, but using on a local machine would probably make the most sense for now
- The .HTML and .JS have to be in the same folder, and for the dumby data the images must be in the subfolder
- Opening and closing the tab will start/stop the project
- For troubleshooting the user must inspect the web page and read the console
    - The most vulnerable parts are currently loading the pages and navigating them
