## Setting Up Project

For setting up the project you have download the repository https://github.com/abbiggs/PDF_ASP.Net .ZIP folder, and extract it (or clone the project). Make sure all the files stay in the same folder. We recommend opening the project in Visual Studio.

Your solution explorer should look like this if everything imported correctly:

If your solution explorer looks different then make sure that you have these nuget packages installed:


## Running Project

You open the project in Visual Studio. Launch the Pdf_In_Browser_1.sln. This will run and should open a file in the default browser. From there you can select the Choose File button and select the PDF document you want to convert to an image. When you are ready to convert the file you click the LoadPDF button. This should display the image of the pdf file in the browser.
